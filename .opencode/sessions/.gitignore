# OpenCode Session Files - Version Control Strategy
#
# By default, we keep all committed sessions in git for team collaboration.
# Uncomment patterns below to exclude certain types of sessions.

# Exclude work-in-progress sessions (naming convention: *-wip-*.json)
# *-wip-*.json

# Exclude very large sessions (you can use git-lfs for these instead)
# Consider adding: *.json filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text in .gitattributes

# Exclude temporary/experimental sessions
# *-temp-*.json
# *-experiment-*.json

# Exclude sessions that might contain sensitive data
# *-sensitive-*.json

# Keep this README in git
!README.md
!.gitignore
